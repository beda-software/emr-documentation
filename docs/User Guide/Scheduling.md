### Create new encounter
Receptionist users should select service and practitioner before they get the ability to create new encounters. To select services and practitioners users can use filters.

**Service filter:** shows available services in the system. If the practitioner has already been selected it will display services provided by the selected practitioner

**Practitioner filter:** shows available practitioners in the system. If the service has already been selected it will display practitioners who provide this selected service.
