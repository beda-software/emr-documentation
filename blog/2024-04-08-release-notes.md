## eReferrals Module Integration

We're excited to announce the new eReferrals module in Beda EMR, automating referral management. During the Sydney HL7 FHIR Connectathon Beda EMR team implemented a gateway solution from Beda EMR eReferral clinical documents into the Sparked eRequesting FHIR repo.

**Highlights**

- **Simplified referral process management.** Share important information about your patient such as demographics, insurance, and encounter details in an automated way
- **Interoperability.** Exchange referral information securely with external systems, ensuring better collaboration and care continuity. The connection can be established with FHIR eReferral repos that support AU FHIR eRequesting IG
- **Customizable Workflows.** Tailor referral processes to fit practice needs and optimize efficiency.


### Next Steps

We'll continue enhancing the eReferrals module based on specification updates, ensuring Beda EMR remains at the forefront of healthcare technology, eliminating old-fashioned paper and fax-based processes.
