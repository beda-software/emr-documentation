Beda EMR Release Notes. July 2023.

Technical Enhancements ðŸ‘‡

<!--truncate-->

In the month of July, our dedicated team has been hard at work implementing various technical enhancements to improve the overall user experience and streamline development processes. We are excited to introduce the following updates:

Enhanced Frontend Development and Testing:

- Storybook v7 Integration: To provide a seamless development experience, all frontend components have been migrated to Storybook v7. This upgrade allows our developers to create, view, and test UI components in isolation, making it easier to spot and fix issues.
- Chromatic Snapshots and Interaction Tests: Our continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline have been enriched with chromatic snapshots and interaction tests. These additions ensure that changes to the frontend code do not negatively impact the user interface and maintain code quality throughout the development process.

Additional Frontend Tools:

- Vite Builder Integration: We have migrated the product into Vite, a blazing-fast build tool and development server for modern JavaScript projects. This integration significantly improves the build and compilation speeds, leading to a faster and more efficient development process.
- Upgraded Versions of Typescript and Eslint: To take advantage of the latest features and improvements, we have upgraded our frontend tools to the latest versions of Typescript and Eslint. This upgrade enhances code correctness, maintainability, and developer productivity.

We believe that these technical enhancements will not only streamline the development process but also lead to a better user experience for our valued customers. As always, we appreciate your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts with us. We are committed to continually improving our product and providing the best possible experience for all our users.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best regards, 
Beda EMR Team
