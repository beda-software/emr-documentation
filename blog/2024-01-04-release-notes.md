Beda EMR Release Notes. December 2023.

# Year wrap-up & AI advancements

Beda Software celebrated the end of 2023 with an exciting hackathon, during which our entire team collaborated on enhancing Beda EMR with cutting-edge AI advancements. The outcome was the successful implementation of two groundbreaking features, both of which we are eager to release and demonstrate shortly.

First and foremost, we introduce the PDF to Questionnaire converter. This innovative tool allows you to effortlessly upload clinical notes in PDF format into Beda EMR's Questionnaire builder. The system then intelligently generates a FHIR questionnaire tailored to your specifications, streamlining the process for more efficient and accurate data entry.

The second remarkable addition is the speech recognition-based form filler. By activating the speech mode for any questionnaire, you can now seamlessly engage in a conversation with your patient, while the system automatically populates the questionnaire based on the spoken information. This hands-free feature not only enhances convenience but also ensures accurate and timely data capture during patient interactions. 

We look forward to showcasing these transformative features in our upcoming release and demos!
